# kS Quick Commands
Shortcuts for the MW3 ingame Commands

All the Commands are only written into the chat without being sent (Except scream)

Do **not** type anything before the cursor stopped moving

"name" will **ALWAYS** be removed, you don't need to do it
  


I hope this makes your life easier
