# TsG-AHK-Commands
Shortcuts for the MW3 ingame Commands

All the Commands are only written into the chat without being sent (Except scream)

Do **not** type anything before the cursor stopped moving

(name) will **ALWAYS** be removed, you don't need to do it

More Games will hopefully come in the future

All the Commands can be found in the Files with descriptions of what they do.

Not every Command works with every Rank
  


I hope this makes your life easier

## Self edit
You can easily edit the AHK-Commands to your liking. For that you need to download AHK (AutoHotKey) and the **.ahk** files from here and start editing
